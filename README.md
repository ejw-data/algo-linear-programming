## Overview  
Linear programming examples using Excel and Python

## Excel Simulations  
1.  `constrained_linear_equations.xlsx` - Selecting product quantity to produce maximize profits and keeping with raw material inventory.
1.  `transportation-goods.xlsx` - Selecting factory production and shipments of each product to each country while minimizing cost, meeting demand, and not exceeding factory capacity.  
1.  `adv-transportation-goods` - work in progress

<br>

## Python Simulations  
1.   `linear-optimization.ipynb` - Python PULP library version of the Excel `constrained_linear_equations.xlsx`
1.  `linear-optimization-shipping.ipynb` - Python PULP library version of the Excel `transportation-goods.xlsx`
1.  `linear-optimization-shipping-pandas.ipynb` - modified version of `linear-optimization-shipping.ipynb` that utilizes pandas dataframes to access data instead of generating lists.
1.  `linear-optimization-warehousing.ipynb` - work in progress
  

### Technologies
